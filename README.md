# About the dataset
In 2006, Taiwan the credit card issuers faced cash and credit card debt crisis.Taiwanese card-issuing banks overissued cash and credit cards to ineligible applicants in an effort to gain market dominance. At the same time, the majority of cardholders accrued significant credit and cash-card debts due to their excessive use of credit cards for consumption, regardless of their capacity to repay the loan. The crisis dealt a serious damage to consumer trust in finance, and it presents a significant challenge to cardholders as well as banks.
